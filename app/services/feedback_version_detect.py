"""
Detect a new questionnaire version of a feedback bot from the questions the stored sessions were asked
(pure functions, no I/O; app/database/feedback_operations.py feeds them).

The bot's scripted question of each step (not the LLM-written probes) is compared with what each version is known
to ask. This only PROPOSES a version and the instant it started: a person records it with
tools/questionnaire_versions.py set. The recorded windows stay the single source of truth for a session's label,
so a label never changes by itself.

How a version's known questions are found: the main questions asked by at least two of the first
`baseline_sessions` sessions stamped with that version (one session suffices when there are fewer than 10).
Limit: a version whose window holds fewer sessions than `baseline_sessions` before the next change learns that
change as its own (lower --baseline-sessions for a small deployment), and a window recorded far too early
pollutes its own reference, so detect finds new question sets but does not audit recorded dates.
When every new question is a close wording variant of a known one (similarity of at least WORDING_SIMILARITY, for
example "you are feeling" against "you're feeling"), nothing is proposed, because a rephrased line is usually not a new
questionnaire; the variants are still listed ("wording_variants") so a real small change, such as a unit changed
inside one question, is visible. `include_wording=True` proposes anyway.
A question text that no version knows, is asked in at least `min_sessions` sessions and in at least
`min_coverage` of the sessions since it first appeared is NEW. The proposed start is the best single step in
time: the instant that leaves the fewest new-question sessions before it and old-question sessions after it.
