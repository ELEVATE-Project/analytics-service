-- =========================================================================
-- SEED CONFIG: the versioned settings stored in the `config` / `config_version` tables, plus the
-- leader categories and programs those configs belong to. Run by app/database/db.py at every start,
-- after schema.sql and the other seed files (it depends on none of them).
--
-- Today: the 1M Voice feedback settings of tenant 'mitra', for the four personas (Youth, Parent,
-- General Public, Educator):
--   * feedback_upload      / mitra         how to read a Mitra raw conversation CSV (one per persona)
--   * feedback_upload      / google_forms  how to read a Google Forms wide CSV (Youth, Parent, General Public)
--   * feedback_extraction  / any           the metadata fields and bands of the LLM extraction and the
--                                          prompt it uses (prompt_name, a row of seed_prompts.sql)
-- Other kinds of config are added to this file in the same pattern (one CONFIG block each).
--
-- Rules every block follows (the file is a seed, never a migration):
--   * The whole seed is a NO-OP when tenant 'mitra' does not exist (the tenant is an environment row;
--     this file never creates it).
--   * Nothing is ever overwritten. leader_category / programs / config are inserted ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
--     under fixed ids; version 1 of a config is inserted ONLY while that config has no version row at
--     all, so a config edited with a new config_version (old one deactivated, kept as history), or one
--     whose version 1 was removed, is never touched and the one-active-version-per-config unique index
--     is never violated. It is idempotent: running it again changes nothing.
--   * The ids are fixed (the personas' ids; the extraction config ids are uuid5 of the config type and
--     the session_type) so every database holds the same rows.
--
-- A database that is already seeded keeps its configs. To change a seeded config there, write a NEW
-- config_version (see docs/feedback-extraction-bands.md, "Changing a band or a field"); to make a fresh
-- database start with the change, edit the JSON of the block below. Only the JSON inside the
-- dollar-quoted literal of a block is config content; each block starts with the marker line
-- `-- CONFIG <config_type> <config_source> <session_type>` (tests/seed_support.py reads the file through
-- these markers, so keep the layout of a block as it is).
